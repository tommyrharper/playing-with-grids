# Playing with grids in react

I ran:
```
npm install node-sass
```

GridList is for react native.

## Grommet

```
npm install grommet styled-components polished --save
```

I have created two Grommet Grids, a GrommetGridFinite and GrommetGridInfinite.

These are two responsive grids
   - First one with a known number of elements
   - Second one with an unknown number of elements
