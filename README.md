# Playing with grids in react

I ran:
```
npm install node-sass
```

GridList is for react native.

## List of Items created

- FlexBox: Simply using CSS Flexbox.
- GrommitOnClickBox: Box that changes onClick using Grommit.
- GrommitBox: Simply some boxes created using Grommit.
- GrommitFinite: A limited number of boxes in a grid.
- GrommitInfinite: An unlimited number of boxes in a grid.

## Grommet

```
npm install grommet styled-components polished --save
```

I have created two Grommet Grids, a GrommetGridFinite and GrommetGridInfinite.

These are two responsive grids
   - First one with a known number of elements
   - Second one with an unknown number of elements

## FlexBox

FlexBox uses plane CSS.
